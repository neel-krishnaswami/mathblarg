# mathblarg

This is a script to take an HTML file with MathJax embedded in it, and to convert all the MathJax to SVG. 
The upshot is that the page should no longer need JS to be legible. At present you'll lose all of the 
accessibility features MathJax support, though.

Intended for math blogging, hence the name. 

You'll need [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) installed.
